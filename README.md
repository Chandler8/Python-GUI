# Future-Development


    - Would like to add a "routines" feature that a user could open up depening upon their desired outcome
                 - For example a user could have a "Work From Home" routine containing all neccessary programs for that situation
                 - A user could also have a "Gaming" routine that opens their desired client for gaming and possibly the steam store so they could add to their arsenal

    - Could also add a delete button within the root that can just delete individual files from your lineup
                 - Let's say if a user accidently added something they dont care to have there

    - Would love to create an automated delete feature that would scrap whole files 
                 - In the event an entire routine got outdated, you could kill it
